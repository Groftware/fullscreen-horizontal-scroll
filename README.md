A component that helps developer to create an element that scroll horizontally using vertical scroll with fullscreen view. It only starts to scroll horizontally when the scroll/view reaches the element.

* It is reponsive, scrolling works on all screen sizes ðŸ“±ðŸ’»ðŸ–¥
* It only scrolls horizontally when it reaches the element, no unwated horizontal scrolling when user are browsing your website
* Solve your problem to do the calculation for scrolling horizontally with vertical scroll ðŸ¤“
*  Scrolls horitonzally as accurate as your vertical scroll ðŸ–± 

## Installation
``` 
npm i @groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll 
```
or

``` 
yarn add @groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll 
```

## Why make such a component?

We wanted to have this feature for our [website](https://groftware.tech), but we couldn't find anything similar.

## How it works?
It takes the children width in containers and apply the height to the wrapper. So when user scrolls vertically, it uses HTML DOM property; which is `scrollLeft`, to mimic the horizontal scroll.  

## Usage
Just wrap the element that you want it to scroll horizontally  `<FullScreenHorizontalScroll>` you are good to go! ðŸŽ‰

Example:

```
import FullScreenHorizontalScroll from '@groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll';

<div>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
  <FullScreenHorizontalScroll>
    {/* Elements that you want to display in the horizontal scroll */}
    <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', height: 200 }}>
      <div style={{ border: '10px solid red', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
    </div>
    <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
  </FullScreenHorizontalScroll>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
</div>
```

		<td>node</td>
		<td>elements that you want to show</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>hideScrollX</td>
		<td>boolean</td>
		<td>default shows horizontal scollbar</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>containerStyle</td>
		<td>object</td>
		<td>React inline style for the container</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>containerClassName</td>
		<td>string</td>
		<td>CSS style for the container</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>centerVertical</td>
		<td>boolean</td>
		<td>vertically center the container and it's child element </td>
	</tr>
</table>

## FAQ

1. Why is my element stretched to window height?

	The container uses `display:flex` and `height: 100vh` along with `maxHeight: 100vh` to achieve fullscreen. And so the height of the element fills the available height by default. Define a height for your element if you do not want the height to be stretch. This problem does not apply to the element's children.
	
1. Can I vertically align my container top or bottom?

	There is `containerStyle` and `containerClassName` props for you to customize the container! Please refer to `alignItems` style in CSS 
	
	An example for this solution:
	
	```	
	import React from 'react';
	
	import FullScreenHorizontalScroll from '@groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll';
	
	function App() {
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	      <FullScreenHorizontalScroll containerStyle={{ alignItems: 'flex-end' }}> // position your container here
	        <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', height: 100 }}>
	          <div style={{ border: '10px solid red', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	        </div>
	        <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	      </FullScreenHorizontalScroll>
	      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default App;
	```
	
1. Why is my element width is being squeeze or stretch when i apply `width: 100%`, `width: auto` or `flex: 1` style?

	This is because the container uses `display: flex` which by default it will expand to windows width. And so the elements width will be stretch/squeeze to match the container width. 

	You may fix it by giving a fixed width.
	
1. The scrolling is wrong when my element has nested children in it

	This is because the container only takes the sibling childrens width to calculate the scrolling. Try to make your nested element expand based on your the children or give a fixed width to fix this issue.
