## Installation

``` 
npm i @groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll 
```
or

``` 
yarn add @groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll 
```

<a name="howitworks"/>

## How it works?
It takes the children width in containers and apply the height to the wrapper. So when user scrolls vertically, it uses HTML DOM property; which is `scrollLeft`, to mimic the horizontal scroll.

## Usage

Just wrap the element that you want it to scroll horizontally  `<FullScreenHorizontalScroll>` you are good to go! üéâ

Example:

```
import FullScreenHorizontalScroll from '@groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll';

<div>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
  <HorizontalScroll>
    {/* Elements that you want to display in the horizontal scroll */}
    <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', height: 200 }}>
      <div style={{ border: '10px solid red', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
    </div>
    <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
  </HorizontalScroll>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
</div>
```

## FAQ

1. Why is my element stretched to window height?

	The container uses `display:flex` and `height: 100vh` along with `maxHeight: 100vh` to achieve fullscreen. And so the height of the element fills the available height by default. Define a height for your element if you do not want the height to be stretch. This problem does not apply to the element's children.
	
1. Can i vertically align my container top or bottom?

	There is `containerStyle` and `containerClassName` props for you to customize the container! Please refer to `alignItems` style in CSS 
	<br/> An example for this solution:
	
	```	
	import React from 'react';
	
	import FullScreenHorizontalScroll from '@groftware/fullscreen-horizontal-scroll';
	
	function App() {
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	      <FullScreenHorizontalScroll containerStyle={{ alignItems: 'flex-end' }}> // position your container here
	        <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', height: 100 }}>
	          <div style={{ border: '10px solid red', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	        </div>
	        <div style={{ border: '10px solid black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	      </FullScreenHorizontalScroll>
	      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'black', width: 1500, height: 100 }} />
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default App;
	```
	
1. Why is my element width is being squeeze or stretch when i apply `width: 100%`, `width: auto` or `flex: 1` style?

	This is because the container uses `display: flex` which by default it will expand to windows width. And so the elements width will be stretch/squeeze to match the container width. 

	<br/> You may fix it by giving a fixed width.
	 
	<br/> If you are curious why is this happening, we Groftware did not made this as intended. You may on research on **flexbox** for further understanding. üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
	
1. The scrolling is wrong when my element has nested children in it

	This is because the container only takes the sibling childrens width to calculate the scrolling. Try to make your nested element expand based on your the children or give a fixed width to fix this issue.

1. My problem is not listed here.

	You may go to the Github pages to open a new issue and we will help you ü•≥ 

Happy hacking! üñ±
